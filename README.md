idea is know how to make scalable 
make sure were using stored procesdsrs

dont run a query without stored procedure

**all queries should have a try and catch with rollback

** at least somewhere in the system used materialized views 

shopping cart checks prereqs and time conflict 

register page which just checks class availability

#meetin request 30 min monday 9 - 930   





#TO ADD AS OF FEB 7 6PM
# maximum credits for the term
# fix days and times to show proper times 
# add option to choose by semester of the year like macewan screen
# add more students to see if full classes function works (or reduce class size for one class)


#QUESTIONS TO ASK
# do we need waitlist function ?
# is registration table okay?
# check code
# check docs and rules 
# check ERD
